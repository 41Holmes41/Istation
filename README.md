1.  The program prints a snack menu and then waits for user input
2.  Once the user has input a selection, the program will desplay the user's selection as well as the price, then wait for the user to input an amount of money
3.  If the user inputs an amount of money less than the price of the selection, the program will prompt the user to input more money and then wait for the input
